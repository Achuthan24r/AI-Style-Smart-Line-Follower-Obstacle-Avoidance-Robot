# Smart Line Follower + Obstacle Avoidance Robot 🚗🤖

## Description
This project is an advanced Arduino-based smart robot that follows a line using IR sensors and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor.  
It mimics basic self-driving logic used in autonomous vehicles.

## Features
- Automatic line following
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Intelligent movement decisions
- Modular and hackathon-ready

## Hardware Used
- Arduino UNO
- L298N Motor Driver
- IR Sensors (2)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo Motor
- DC Motors
- Battery Pack

## Working
1. IR sensors detect the line path.
2. Ultrasonic sensor checks for obstacles.
3. If obstacle detected, robot stops, reverses, and turns.
4. Otherwise, it continues line following.

## Applications
- Autonomous vehicle learning
- Robotics competitions
- Hackathons & mini projects
- AI & automation basics

## Future Enhancements
- Bluetooth or WiFi control
- Camera-based vision
- AI decision making using ESP32
